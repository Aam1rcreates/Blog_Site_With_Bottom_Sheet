## What is a Bottom Sheet?
A bottom sheet is a user-interface pattern used commonly in mobile apps for providing contextual details or controls in the lower area of the screen.
You might have encountered it while watching YouTube videos as well. In any YouTube video, when you click on the comment, you will see a pop-up from the bottom of the screen, that covers half of the screen with comments from different accounts showing up, You can also expand it up for it to cover the whole screen. So, that is the Bottom Sheet. 
And that's a feature that is the main focus for this <strong>Blog Site</strong> too.

## How it works?
It's simple, you just have to click on the comment button to view the bottom sheet in action.
